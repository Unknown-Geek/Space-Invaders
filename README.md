Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1978. this game is a spin-off and simpler version of the original work.The objective of the game is to control a spaceship and shoot down waves of invading aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. The game ends as soon as an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, evading the spaceship.

The player controls the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys and shoots lasers using the spacebar. The aliens move back and forth across the screen and gradually move closer to the player's spaceship. The player can choose the number of aliens and choose from three speed modes (easy, intermediate, hard) in the terminal window. Each alien shot down contributes 100 points to the player. The final score will be displayed at the end of the game.
